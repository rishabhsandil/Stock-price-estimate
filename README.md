## Data

Scripts used to collect and format the data


Stock prices often follow the butterfly effect. They Are hard to model
over long time scales. So this project tries to study the quarterly reports, which contain information that can have influence
on stock prices
Goals:
• Produce a database with at least 10,000 samples
• Predict whether the price will increase or decrease with 70%
accuracy
• Choose 3 classifiers to compare and contrast
• Given quarterly report data along with other data attempt to
predict short-term changes in stock price following their release
